# Did Someone Say, "Cookies"???? Combining the Evidence.

<div class="aside">
<h3>To-Do List</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Upload the evidence and number the fanny pack as evidence #4.</li>
  <li>Combine all 4 photos in order to show the evidence laid out as one image.</li>
</ul>
</div>

More evidence! Can we hope this is the last? Your team opened up the fanny pack and found delicious looking cookies that were somewhat nibbled on.

Strangely, a trail of cookie crumbs were found to lead to a boat. Your team needs you to put together all of your evidence and send it as one single photo to print for the records.

## Take a Copy of the Photo Evidence #4 - Cookies!
