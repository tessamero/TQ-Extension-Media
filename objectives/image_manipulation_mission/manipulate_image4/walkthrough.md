# Hint

You can easily add image overlays to your image right in the URL. Using <strong>l_imagename</strong> as the image to overlay, you will have the image be l_case-closed/boat.jpg. Assuming the caseclosed photo is called case-closed, and the boat photo is called boat.jpg. Refer to the documentation here: https://cloudinary.com/blog/adding_watermarks_credits_badges_and_text_overlays_to_images


<li> Right click and save the photo of the image of the boat and the case-closed sign.</li>
<li> Go to cloudinary.com and login. Click on "Media Library" and click on the blue "Upload" button on the top right corner.</li>
<li> Click on browse to navigate to the photo of the case-closed , then upload it.</li>
<li> Right click the image and click on "Edit" and rename it to "santahat" on the top left of the screen, if it isn't named already.</li>
<li> Edit the image parameter to include </strong>l_text:Arial_64_bold:2</strong> after the <strong>upload/</strong> path, before the filename or version/filename.</li>
<li> You can right click on the image to "Copy URL" which will be the answer to this question.</li>
<li> You can also click on "View Image" if you are already in the "Edit" screen to retrieve your URL.</li>
<li> Post the URL in the answer box.</li>
